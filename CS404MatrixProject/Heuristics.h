-> Remove largest dimension first to find the largest value of the "inner" dimensions, {d0, d1,..., d(n-1)},
-> and multiply the two matrices with this shared largest dimension.Repeat until all matrices are processed.
-> If two interior dimensions are equal, then the first occurance is used.
Pre: takes a vector of the dimensions {d0, d1,..., dn}
Post: returns the cost of following heuristic A.

-> If the product of two different di's are equal, then the first occurance is used.

Heuristic C:
-> Remove smallest dimension first, find smallest value of inner dimensions, {d1,..., d(n-1)},

-> If two interior dimensions of the same size are present, then the first occurance is used.
Pre: takes a vector of the dimensions {d0,..., dn}.
Post: returns the cost of following heuristic C.
